# Project 1

Team 4 chose to create a site that utilizes the NASA picture of the day as a background and then shows a joke of the day.  When a user arrives at the site it will notify them that this site does not use cookies. Users can then select the type of joke they would like and the selection will be saved to local storage which will be remembered the next time the user visits. Users will have the option to change the type of joke if they would like. They can also choose the lenth of the joke. Once these selections are made users will be presented with a joke.  Once they are finished they will be notified that their joke has been sent to Team Four's Slack party lounge.

# Project 1

Team 4 chose to create a site that utilizes the NASA picture of the day as a background and then shows a joke of the day.  When a user arrive at the site it will notify them that this site does not use cookies. Users can then select the type of joke they would like and their selection will be saved to local storage that will be remembered the next time they visit the site.  Users will have the option to change their type of joke if they would like. They can also choose the lenth of the joke. Once these selections are made users will be presented with a joke.  After viewing the joke,they will have the option to rate the joke. After rating the joke they are notified that there choices have been saved.  Once they are finished they are notified that there joke has been sent to Team Four's Slack party lounge.
